# Password-less apps: implementing WebAuthN

## Main info
45' by Daniele Garnier-Moiroux (Spring) and Josh Long (Spring)

see the conference here:

What is WebAuthn and how can we use safely passkeys to authenticate  and then a demo using spring

negatives:
- none, it was a great talk

## Notes

WebAuthn is a spec from WSC:
- use hardware (phone, usbKey) to authenticate => they are called passkeys

It is a protocol/mechanism adopted by Apple, Microsoft and Google (yes, they agreed on something)

This protocol uses asymetrric cryptography

2 phases:
- registration ceremony (generate key pair, save private keyt anbd share public key with website)
- Authentication (sign a challenge with private key and it to server where it is decripted with public key)

Spring supports this kind of authentication: Spring Security 6.4
