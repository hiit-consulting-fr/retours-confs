# OpenTelemetry Hands-On

## Main info


In today's modern software landscape - in the cloud-native one in particular - observability has become a critical aspect of ensuring the performance, reliability, and security of applications. OpenTelemetry, a standard and open-source observability framework, provides a unified way to collect and export telemetry data from applications and services. This hands-on lab will guide participants through the process of using OpenTelemetry to instrument a simple application, collect metrics, traces, and logs, and send them to various backends for analysis.

The lab covers the implementation and usage of OpenTelemetry into Python and Java-based applications. Each participant will get a dedicated environment.

The exercises include
- the instrumentation of a polyglot microservice application
- auto-instrumentation vs. manual instrumentation
- evaluating the collected traces, logs and metrics
- configuring a collector
- analyzing the results in Jaeger

- This lab is made for developers seeking a pragmatic understanding of OpenTelemetry's immediate benefits. Walk away with practical skills that can be implemented right away in your projects, and elevate your observability game in just 180 minutes.
