# Password-less apps: implementing WebAuthN

## Main info

Passwords are everywhere, and they’re a mess! Once you create a good, strong, secure password, you’re rewarded with the task of having to rotate them periodically and store them! There’s got to be a better way. Spring Security is the world’s most widely used security framework for application developers, and it is here to help. In this talk, join us, Daniel Garnier-Moiroux (Spring Security contributor) and Josh Long (Developer Advocate Extraodinaire), as we look at WebAuthN - a protocol and framework for passwordless authentication based on physical devices, like a Yubikey, a macOS touchID, or iOS FaceID - and how to integrate it into a Spring Boot application.
